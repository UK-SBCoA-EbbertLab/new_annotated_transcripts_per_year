# Long-read sequencing expression data

Transcript and gene expression counts matrices for Nanopore long-read sequencing data used in this experiment can be found under `./raw/`

Different normalizations and subsets of the data used in this experiment can be found under `./processed/`

Long-read sequencing data were obtained from a previous experiment in the lab. Details about the data and how it was processed can be found at: https://github.com/UK-SBCoA-EbbertLab/brain_cDNA_discovery
